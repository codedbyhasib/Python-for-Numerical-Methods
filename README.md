# üßÆ Numerical Methods with Python

This repository contains Python implementations of key algorithms and concepts from my **Numerical Methods** course. The code is written to demonstrate how numerical techniques can be applied to solve mathematical and engineering problems using Python libraries like NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib.
